# 🚀 90-Day Roadmap — Bill Walsh Branding Style

## 📌 Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1–4)

### Marketing & Branding
- Craft a **bold positioning statement** (e.g., *“I turn messy startup ideas into boardroom-ready strategies.”*).  
- Refresh LinkedIn headline and banner to match this.  
- Begin a weekly **Top Voice–style post cadence** (short, powerful insights; end with engagement questions).  

### Book Writing
- Define book outline: 8–10 chapters built from your existing posts, newsletters, and prompts.  
- Start capturing micro-stories (personal wins, founder lessons, veteran leadership).  

### Personal Brand
- Create a one-page **“About You” brand sheet**: photo, tagline, 3 signature frameworks you teach.

## 📌 Phase 2: Visibility (Weeks 5–8)

### Marketing & Digital Presence
- Launch a **newsletter series** (“Ashes to Architect”) with consistent weekly drops.  
- Share **2 polished workflows or diagrams** that show your frameworks in action.  
- Begin 1–2 **short video clips** explaining key concepts (post on LinkedIn).  

### Book Writing
- Draft 3 chapters (aim for 1 per week).  
- Repurpose LinkedIn posts as content for these chapters.  

### Networking
- Attend at least 1 **virtual or in-person founder event**.  
- Use the “Be in every room” principle: follow up with 3 people after.

## 📌 Phase 3: Expansion (Weeks 9–12)

### Marketing & Authority
- Publish a **mini case study** on how you help startups translate chaos into clarity.  
- Pitch yourself for **1 podcast or panel appearance** (start small, industry-aligned).  
- Create a **lead magnet** (free PDF guide: “5 AI Prompts Every Founder Needs”).  

### Book Writing
- Draft remaining chapters, refine introduction and conclusion.  
- Begin thinking about publishing path (Amazon self-publishing, partner, or speaking funnel).  

### Personal Brand
- Announce your upcoming book as “in progress” (this builds anticipation and credibility).  
- Package your first **signature talk** (20 minutes: *“From Jobseeker to Builder — My AI Architect Story”*).

## ✅ Bill Walsh Principle
> “Speed loves clarity.”  
Every 30 days, you should be able to show measurable output — posts, chapters, case studies, or leads.  
Consistency compounds into authority.
